    h1 Working These Crazy Hours Was #[strong Normal]

    aside.notes.
      Most days, I'd wake up around 9, check my email immediately, and stay
      connected to work almost constantly — while getting coffee, during meals,
      at drinks with friends — all day. I'd stay up late because I believed I
      could get more done after email and chat died down; often I'd be up until
      2 or 3 in the morning. In 2013, I was working 70–90 hours each week.

    aside.notes.
      All the things we like about ourselves — ambition, perseverance, passion

      enough is enough, sacrificing when it's a bad idea to sacrifice.

    p Compared to the same period of time at 40 hours a week.#[sup 6]

    aside.notes.
      It turns out that working more than 40 hours a week is actually worse for
      productivity. After a month or two, our exhaustion takes too big a toll
      on us: we start making more mistakes; we spend more time staring into
      space while we unconsciously refresh our inboxes — we're "working", but
      we're not really getting much done.

    aside.notes.
      Overworked employees are more stressed, unhappier, unhealthier, and more
      resentful of their jobs. Our jobs — especially those of us who started
      out "chasing our passion" — should NOT feel like burdens; if they do,

      one night, the next day you're impaired faster, and so on.

    aside.notes.
      The goal isn't to wring out every last productive second from a team;
      instead, we should be setting clear, realistic deadlines and letting our
      teams complete them. If they're consistently done in half the allotted
      time, these are your star employees — don't punish them with extra work.
      Reward them with more exciting projects, bonuses, etc.

    aside.notes.
      Without sleep, we can't perform at our best. Without leisure time, we cut
      off our subconscious mind from processing new ideas. Without our health,
      we end up missing work and adding more stress. Without passion, a job is
      just a job: we stop doing work we're proud of and start punching a clock.

      Some people can't work unless they're in an office. Others do better in a

      the trap of trying to force different people to be productive the same

    aside.notes.
      A team that feels trusted will take ownership of projects. When we have
      someone hanging over our shoulder second-guessing all our decisions, we
      don't feel in control. Control allows us to make decisions that we know
      will help. You hired people for their skills; trust them to apply those

      Accept responsibility. We got ourselves into this mess, and only we can

      force you to work more than you're willing to give. Placing the blame on

  OUTLINE:

  Part I: We have a problem

    - Our relationship with work is fucked
    - I learned this the hard way
      - Beard story
      - Overworking like this wasn't unusual for me
    - I shared my story
      - Went nuts online, tons of email from people who felt the same way
    - So what's going on?
    - Here's how things are today:
      - Stats
      - Karoshi
    - We've been duped by our own best qualities
      - All the things we like about ourselves:
        - ambition
        - perseverance
        - passion
      - Can be used for evil if we're not careful:
        - obsession
        - not knowing when enough is enough
        - sacrificing when it's a bad idea to sacrifice
    - Workplace culture reflects this attitude and encourages it
      - Have to show up early to show you care
      - Can't leave before your coworkers ... to show you care
      - Have to be available **always**
      - Must prioritize work over all else
      - "Sleep when you're dead"
    - This is not just unhealthy; it's wrong.
    - Overworking hurts employees:
      - worse health
      - less sleep (which is a whole issue in itself)
      - more burnout
      - lower life satisfaction
    - Overworking hurts businesses:
      - higher turnover
      - lower engagement
      - less output
      - more mistakes (decreased efficiency)
      - increased resentment (shittier culture)


  Part II: There's a better way (for everyone)

    - There are companies doing things the right way
      - New Relic
      - Buffer
      - Precision Nutrition
    - Best Buy used ROWE
      - Turnover plummeted (nearly cut in half)
      - Engagement went up
      - The company didn't fail
      - (Until some jerk came in and ruined it for everyone.)
    -


  Part III: Here's how you can do it *today*

    - We need to reassess what work means
      -
    - Time ≠ Productivity
      - Measure results, not hours
    -


  Part I: The Way We Work Is Broken
  Part II: There's a Better Way (for Everyone)
  Part III: Here's How to Do It

  The idea is to take all the problems from both sides: how our current working culture negatively effects both workers and businesses; how fixing it helps both; how to implement solutions organizationally and personally.

  I'm going to try not to be too prescriptive about anything, but instead give general talking points and rough guidelines for solving problems — the details will vary too much from person to person (and business to business).

  - What is the Overkill Cult?
      - Quote
      - Our best qualities are used against us
  - The Beard Story pt. 1 (Black Friday)
  - The lies of the OC
      - Can't leave early
      - More hours equals more output
      - Sleep when you're dead
      - Time on anything but work is wasted
  - The Beard Story pt. 2 (the patch appears, mustache, full burnout)
  - The Truth About Work
      - We work for a better life
      - Productivity is not linear
      - Rewarding butts in chairs sends the wrong message
      - Sleep is not optional
      - Alone (disconnected) time is essential (subconscious, creativity)
      - Play makes us better at everything
  - If We Know All This, Why Is It Happening?
      - For workers:
          - Passion spins into obsession
          - The desire to provide becomes focused only on money
          - Peer pressure mounts
          - Exhaustion and burnout snowball until it feels like you can't get ahead
      - For businesses:
          - Poor planning leads to looming deadlines
          - Crunch mode leads to overworking
          - Overworking leads to lower productivity
          - Lower productivity leads to more looming deadlines
  - Everyone Wins with Healthier Work Habits
      - Employees get:
          - Lower stress
          - Better health
          - More time for their loved ones/hobbies
          - Increased productivity
          - Increased happiness
          - Better job satisfaction
          - More creativity
      - Businesses get:
          - Fewer absences
          - Lower overhead (remote workers are cheaper; useless employees are outed)
          - Increased profits (due to increased productivity)
          - Better engagement
          - Lower turnover rates
          - More innovation (due to boosted creativity)
  - The Beard Story pt. 3 (radical reprioritization, more productivity, recovery)
  - How to Escape
      - Accept responsibility: you're not a victim, and you always have a choice
      - Set limits for yourself and others
      - Take control of your attention span
      - Group tasks by context
      - Plan full days off
      - When you're not at work, stop working
  - How to Fix Your Company Culture
      - Reward the right type of behavior (results-based work)
      - Be flexible with your employees' working styles (remote, office, open)
      - Enforce good behavior (no email after hours, etc. — New Relic)
      - Trust the team (transparency, ownership, etc. — Holocracy et al.)
  - The Solution Is Simple. Not Easy
      - Old habits die hard
      - We have to stay vigilant until better habits take hold
      - Try to remember that the world won't fall apart if you're not checking email
  - Close Your Computer. Go Outside. And Call Your Friends; They Miss You.
